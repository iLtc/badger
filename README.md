# Badge Generator

If you have a Badger 2040 badge, this little SPA web app will help you customize it from the comfort of your own web browser. As long as that web browser supports the Web Serial API's (i.e. Chrome or Edge).

[Badge Generator](https://badger.iltc.app/)

First of all, type your name, job title, and company.

Plug in the badge to your desktop machine - ideally directly and not via a USB Hub.
Next up, press "Copy to badge".

You then need to select the serial device to connect to. If you are not sure, unplug the badge and see which one dissapeared and then plug it back in again and select it

When the files have been uploaded, the badge will reset.

If "Copy to Badge" doesn't work, you can also manually download the badge.png file to your computer, then drag and drop it onto your badger using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).
